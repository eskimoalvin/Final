a margin that spans 20% giving the page a more centered appearence. it also centers my h1 tag-->

      <p>Elite Dangerous is a game that can be considered confusing for even the most veteran players. Due to the sheer size and scope of the game, it can be easy to get lost.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the community has come together and created some of the best websites to help commanders out on their journey.</p>

      <h2> <a href="https://coriolis.io/" target="_blank">Coriolis</a></h2>
      <p>This is a website that allows you to build ships and shows you where you can get the parts that you need to ensure that your ship is fashioned to your liking.
      This site is named after the type of starport in the game that goes by the same name. This will help to ensure that you are able to get the ship that you need and find the closest location to get it.
      I have used this site many times while upgrading my ships and ensuring that they are exactly where they need to be.</p>

      <h2> <a href="https://eddb.io/system" target="_blank">EDDB.io</a></h2>
      <p>This site is another site that is community made and helps commanders out on their journey. This site allows you to filter the systems that are around you.<br>
      Some of these systems are controlled by various factions that maybe you are trying to gain reputation with. Some of these factions allow for you to recieve discounts on your ships.
    Whatever it is that you want, you are able to filter systems and the game will show you where the closest one that meets your specifications is.
      This site gets a little less traffic from me but is still very userful nonetheless.</p>

      <h2> <a href="https://cmdrs-toolbox.com/" target="_blank">CMDRS Toolbox</a></h2>
      <p>This site fills a role that is a little different from the other ones that have been linked before. This is more of an all in one type of website. It focuses on a lot of different things.
      It can show you where important materials that you need for your ships upgrades can be located. There is also a ship builder similar to the one shown above. There is a spot to
      plan trips to ensure that you are taking the least amount of jumps through hyperspace. There is also a part for you to find how much it would cost to purchase and maintain something called a Fleet Carrier.
      </p>
      <h2> <a href="https://inara.cz/" target="_blank">Inara</a></h2>
      <p>While the rest of the sites that have been linked so far have been focused on more utility, this site has a primary function of connectivity. This site helps to ensure that you are able to connect with commanders from all over.
      There is a system in place for joining groups of commanders that have similar goals to you. This will help to ensure that you are ready to have someone to team up with whenever you are on. I actually used this website to join the
      squadron that I am currently a part of. They took me in and helped to ensure that I was welcomed and actually introduced me to most of these websites. Any time I had any questions, They helped me find answers.</p>
