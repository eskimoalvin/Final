  blue color it also makes the table wide enough to fit the whole page and it gives it
a margin that spans 20% giving the page a more centered appearence. it also centers my h1 tag-->

      <h2>My Fleet</h2>
      <p>In Elite Dangerous, one of the best things to do is to collect a series of ships, called a fleet. This fleet is yours to own and use however you see fit. Varying ships have different purposes and they are all good to have. <br>
      Once you have bought your ships, you can use a premium currency that you are able to purchase yourself or earn throughout playing normally. This currency is called ARX. These are able to be spent on skins for the ships or colors of lasers and thrusters. </p>

      <p>I own the following ships</p>
      <ul>
