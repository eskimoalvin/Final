a margin that spans 20% giving the page a more centered appearence. it also centers my h1 tag-->

    <h2>What is elite dangerous?</h2>
    <p>Elite dangerous is a game that allows for the player base to do anything they wish.</p>
    <p>It takes place in space and allows for limitless content. This game is what is called a "sandbox game."</p>
    <p>What this means is that the players are able to do anything that they want.</p>
    <p>There are numerous activities or careers that are available for players to choose from.</p>
    <p>Some of these are:</p>
    <!-- This is just a quick paragraph explaining the game-->
    <ul>
      <li>Running a space trucking business.</li>
      <li>Mining asteroids for minerals and selling them.</li>
      <li>Pirate activities like killing NPC ships.</li>
      <li>Running a cruise line to take people to the furthest reaches of the galaxy.</li>
      <!--this is a list that shows all the different things that you are able to do-->
    </ul>
    <p>As you can see, there are quite a lot of things that you can do in this game.</p>
    <p>Probably the absolute coolest thing in the game is the fact that it is a 1:1 scale representation of our Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
    <p>This provides us with a feeling that the space is a big empty void.</p>
