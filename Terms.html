  <!-- this is my style section, this makes it so that the page color is the NASA
  blue color it also makes the table wide enough to fit the whole page and it gives it
a margin that spans 20% giving the page a more centered appearence. it also centers my h1 tag-->

    <h2>What do all of the terms mean?</h2>
    <p>We will be covering quite a few terms that are relevent to Elite. They all refer to various parts of the game.</p>

    <h3>Commander</h3>
    <p>This is a broad term for all of the various pilots that sail the sky.</p>
    <p>When talking to someone else in game, to ensure that you are using the broadest term available, you'll just call someone "commander"</p>
    <p>There is a common greeting or signing off for commanders to use "o7".</p>
    <p>This is meant to signify a salute of sorts. It is a fun way to adknowledge other commanders.</p>

    <h3>FSD</h3>
    <p>The FSD is a Frame Shift Drive. What this does is it allows for commanders to travel faster than light.</p>
    <p>The FSD is probably the most import part of any ship.</p>
    <p>The Frame Shift Drive uses the fuel that the ship holds.</p>
    <p>It has 2 modes, one of them is the supercruise which allows for in system FTL travel.</p>
    <p>The other mode is hyperspace travel. This allows for fast traveling between star systems.</p>

    <h3>Limpets</h3>
    <p>Limpets are small robots able to do a variety of tasks.</p>
    <p>They can be programmed to do all sorts of things like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect things</li>
      <li>Prospecting rocks</li>
      <li>Sending fuel to other ships</li>
      <li>Repairing your ship and other's ships.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you can see limpets are quite versatile. They are programmed by "limpet controllers".</p>
    <p>All of these tasks are important to ensure that you are able to do any of the many things that the game offers.</p>

    <h3>Fuel Scoops</h3>
    <p>As you would expect, space is large. Traveling in it is tough even for the ships that have the most fuel.</p>
    <p>Stars give off some form of hydrogen. This is what the fuel in Elite is made out of.</p>
    <p>Ships with a special module are able to "scoop" this hydrogen that the stars give off.</p>
    <p>Only some stars are able to give off hydrogen, however. What this means is that when you are traveling, you need to keep in mind what stars can be scooped for fuel.</p>
    <p>Stars are divided into "classes". The ones that are able to be scooped are "O, B, A, F, G, K, and M."</p>
    <p>There is an acronym that we use to remember the scoopable stars. KGB FOAM. This is fun to say and helps commanders to remember.</p>
